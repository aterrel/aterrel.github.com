    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been a week since the end of <a href="http://conference.scipy.com/scipy2013/">SciPy2013</a>, where I was co-chair, and I'm just now catching my breath.  It was an amazing event with so many innovative and forward looking trends that I won't be able to give them enough credence, ever.  When I took on the role as co-chair, my guiding goal was to provide a home to scientific researcher engineers, whether they are in government labs, industry, or academia.  Just as <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2041/scipy-2013-keynote-the-new-scientific-publishers-1">William Schroeder said in his keynote</a>, we are the new scientific publishers and are the driving force behind much of the technology that is changing the world.</p>

<h2>Favorite Moments</h2>

<p>Let me give a list of the best moments for me at SciPy2013, I'm sure I will be
commenting on them throughout the year.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The SciPy Proceedings have moved to a fully open peer review process for more details see <a href="http://stefanv.github.io/blog/2013/06/27/scipy2013-proceedings/">Stefan van der Walt's blog</a></p></li>
<li><p>There were a huge number of commits to 18 projects. Including these
highlights (mostly gleaned from <a
href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23scipy2013&src=typd">#scipy2013</a>.)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Matplotlib had over a dozen contributors (including a 10K LOC patch
review).</p></li>
<li><p>Scikit-Image now runs on Python 3 and 2 from single code base (without
2to3).</p></li>
<li><p>IPython developers sequestered themselves to focus on the ever-promised
1.0 released.</p></li>
<li><p>Contributers to over 16 projects came together to <a
href="https://github.com/IgnitionProject/ignition/wiki/CodeGenComposability_Scipy2013">discuss
commonalities with the compiler technology</a> that is being reproduced in
each other's code.</p></li>
<li><p>Please let me know of any other major achievements at SciPy2013 sprints.  We need to collect these stories to help convince sponsors.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We had >350 people attend, >500 <a href="http://eventifier.co/event/scipy2013/">people tweeting</a>, social events almost every night, <a href="http://pyvideo.org/category/37/scipy-2013">139 videos</a> including <a href=http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/tutorials_schedule.php">12 amazing tutorials</a> diving into every aspect of science, and over 6% of the conference either named Matt or from France.</p></li>
<li><p>Hosted a gathering of Women in Science with a wide array of participants with the help of PyLadies, The Python Software Foundation, and NumFOCUS.</p></li>
<li><p>Over 10 BoFs that provided for a much more participatory discussion on major topics facing our community.</p></li>
<li><p>And yet another <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ywHqIEv3xXg#t=1892s">completely ridiculous lightning talk from Matt Terry</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Once again I want to give a shout out to all our wonderful sponsors! Without them there would be no SciPy conference (or at least one with less BBQ).</p>

<h2>Other's words</h2>
