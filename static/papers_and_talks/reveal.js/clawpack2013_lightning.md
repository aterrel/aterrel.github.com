I use *mathematical abstractions* to build *robust*, *performant* scientific codes
using the world's largest supercomputers.  


To achieve *performance*, I use *generic programming techniques* such as *embedding
domain specific languages* into the simulation code.


Most of my applications come from *Computational Fluid Dynamics*, but I've been
known to dabble in other fields as well.



## Goals this week

- Finish [ManyClaw](http://github.com/ManyClaw/ManyClaw) release  
- Run some Clawpack test problems on  
[Stampede](http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/resources/hpc/stampede) with
[p4est](http://p4est.org) and [ForestClaw](http://www.forestclaw.org)
- Implement Randy's test problem in ManyClaw  
- Link [Ignition](http://github.com/IgnitionProject/Ignition) to writing
ManyClaw applications.
