I seem to be waking up with purpose every morning so I felt it good to get a list of things I would like to do in 2025. Yeah this list is too long but gives my future self a direction.

## Daily General Life

> *The heavens declare the glory; the skies proclaim the work.*

- Serve my family,
- Read a holy scripture,
- Find meaning in my work, and
- Exercise.

## OSS Software

> *The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously.*

- Find a way to commit code every day
- Launch a pip prototype with gpu aware metadata semantics, follow at [wheel-next](https://github.com/wheel-next)
- Build Pure Python versions of AI algorithms that perform e.g. [llm.py](https://github.com/aterrel/llm.py)
- Explore the boundaries between languages and libraries for gpu computing. See [numba-cuda](https://github.com/nvidia/numba-cuda) and [triton-lang](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton)
- Contribute to my favorite libraries and tools:
	- numba
	- CPython
	- pixi
	- dask
	- bokeh
	- DISCOVER-Cookbook
	- LFortran/LPython
- Help raise the standards of governance in the PyData projects and the NumFOCUS projects
- Help guide the NumFOCUS community hire a new executive director

## Hobbies

> *Satisfy your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s*

- Redesign my website and tinker with a few applications
- Complete my woodworking todo list
	- bunk beds for kids
	- end grain cutting boards and pens for gifts
	- handtool chest from hand tool school
- Read 12 books (currently on the list, need suggestions for non-western male authors):
	- Life by Pope Francis
	- The Godfather by Mario Puzo
	- The intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham
	- Something by Ted Chiang
	- Stormlight Archive book 5 (Wind and Truth) by Brandon Sanderson
- Set up a family wildlife preserve (went hunting with the kids this year and would like to have a place we can go enjoy nature as my house in the woods is not surrounded by a golf course.)
