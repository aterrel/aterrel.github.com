&lt;p&gt;So long academia and thanks for all the debates!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day of a wonderful three years at the University of Texas at
Austin. Starting Monday, following Jake Vanderplas'
&lt;a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/big-data-brain-drain/"&gt;terminology&lt;/a&gt;,
I join the big data brain drain.  I will be joining Continuum Analytics a their
Chief Computational Scientist, with a focus of helping them join HPC
technologies to the Big Data world.  But that is another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to be a scientist since I was quite young, okay I really wanted
to be a jet pilot but my genes killed that one. I remember the day that I
decided to become a computational scientist.  It was at the
&lt;a href="http://www.math.ttu.edu/Department/Calendar/Conferences/redraider/rr2003/red03.html"&gt;Red Raider Minisymposium on Biological Systems&lt;/a&gt;.
I heard an excellent discussions by James Keener and Charles Taylor on the role
of computational mathematics and understanding cardiovascular
systems. Additionally I was basically offered a position at the prestigious
University of Chicago on the spot.  The idea that I could contribute to
treating the medical ailment that has claimed the lives of many in my family.
To this end, I was elated when
&lt;a href="http://cbc.simula.no/pub/"&gt;center for biomedical computing at Simula&lt;/a&gt; started
using the &lt;a href="http://fenicsproject.org/"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; I helped with in graduate
school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduate school, I've had the amazing opportunity to collaborate with
scientists from a diverse set of applications and backgrounds. I've traveled to
four continents to present my work and collaborate.  I've released several
coding projects that have pushed the boundaries of computational mathematics
field in numerics on accelerators, adaptive meshes, and domain specific
languages.  Some of these discoveries have even pushed into
&lt;a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/"&gt;PETSc&lt;/a&gt;, the premier HPC platform produced by
the Argonne Lab.  Additionally, I have had the privileged of helping with the
scientific python community taking the role of advocating and organizing the
SciPy conference and the NumFOCUS foundation.  In the coming months I will be
an editor for the Scientific Software Days issue in CiSE magazine.  Its been a
jam packed three years and there are only a few things I would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my deep respect for academia, I have come to terms that it is
fundamentally not the right fit. I've had on and off moments where I start
something in industry and come back, but this time is much different. After
finally getting a rather large grant from the US Army, I had thought that I
would finally have some time to determine my own direction.  Unfortunately, due
to no part of mine, the grant was cut in half. My own deliverables were
slipping so the rest of the money was on a slippery slope. The government
sequestration and shutdown meant that my money would definitely be out before
it could be renewed.  Just like that, I went from well funded PI to soft
money beggar.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presented with a choice of bouncing around on other PI's grants and hoping to get
a more permanent position or moving to industry.  I shopped around my CV to
see if I had a shot on the academic job market, but was told that I was
not competitive by several friendly collaborators.  Most hires, even in
computer science and applied mathematics, are people who have been out of
graduate school for five or more years. On top of this, the general perception
was I am "just the coder" for the work.  So when my friends at &lt;a href="http://continuum.io"&gt;Continuum
Analytics&lt;/a&gt; gave me a call to do some of the most ambitious work I've seen, I
didn't hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Call for sustaining career paths for scientific coders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could I have salvaged my academic career? Absolutely.  But the events above
makes me stop and ask if I wanted to.  Having turned down offers that tripled my
salary for years, I've stayed with science to make an impact on the wider
world.  I think academia does make the world a much better place.
Unfortunately, I also see my role as the scientific coder being diminished year
after year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can point to half a dozen folks I know not getting tenure.  People in post
doctoral roles for a decade. Families living in different countries trying to
keep their academic careers alive. And almost no academic I've ever met has a
good work life balance. I'm willing to give up a lot to be an academic, but now
that I have two children and one on the way, I'm not interested in giving up as
much as it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with academia being a hard place to make a career, you add to the fray
that the field doesn't acknowledge code as a scholarly work and I'm out. At
Supercomputing 2013 I saw three different presentations
(&lt;a href="http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/"&gt;WSSSPE&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://sc13.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail.php?evid=inspkr101"&gt;Saul Perlmutter's plenary&lt;/a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href="http://sc13.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail.php?evid=bof184"&gt;a BoF on Sequencing and Accelerators&lt;/a&gt;
) all calling for better coders in science. But as pointed out again and again,
the motivating factors are not in favor of better code in science.  Without a
sustainable career path for those who are motivated to be "just the coder",
science will continue to not compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more persistent complaints I and many of my colleagues have had is
being the lone coder in a larger group. One astrophysicist turned startup
monkey once told me, "I'm tired of being the only one in my group that knows
what an expression tree is."  We need more computer science skills for our
scientific staff.  Unfortunately, computer science departments across the
country are trying to move scientific computing out of their department. With
only a few scientific computing departments in the entire US, there is a lack
of options for scientific computing professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have volunteered as much time as I can afford to promoting and
training folks like me with
&lt;a href="http://software-carpentry.org/"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://conference.scipy.org/index.html"&gt;SciPy conferences&lt;/a&gt;. The recent news of
the
&lt;a href="http://www.moore.org/newsroom/press-releases/2013/11/12/%20bold_new_partnership_launches_to_harness_potential_of_data_scientists_and_big_data"&gt;Moore Foundation and Sloan Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
to further the careers of folks like me is a welcome message.  With the
increase of science relying on advanced technologies and the increased rate of
retracted publications due to software errors, academia must adapt. As a person
who advocated for better software at an
&lt;a href="www.tacc.utexas.edu"&gt;NSF Supercomputing facility&lt;/a&gt;, I can only wonder how long
until the NSF makes a center for open sustainable software. Money for the hardware is
just not enough to advance the cyber-infrastructure of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Advocate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the door to academia never truly closes, I will have an opportunity to
work with an amazing team that is using much of the scientific technologies
I've grown to love.  A scientist at heart, I plan to continue helping with
SciPy and NumFOCUS, but as a industrial scientist with a team of very talented
coders. My hope is to keep working with folks in academia to take their ideas
to new levels of impact on the world they are passionate about helping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the great @dabeaz did while I was a student in his class, I give the 21 gun
salute to my academic career. So long and thanks for all the great debates.&lt;/p&gt;

Thyng&lt;/a&gt; about an event we both worked to organize at SciPy2013.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andy.terrel.us/figures/1-IMG_0723.JPG" title="Image title&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;45%" /&gt; &lt;img alt="" src="http://andy.terrel.us/figures/2-IMG_0726.JPG" title="Image title&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;45%" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in other computing fields, women make up a small percentage of the people in scientific computing. In order to bring together the women at the SciPy conference to aid in building community and to discuss related issues, a mixer was held during one of the evening Birds of a Feather sessions, moderated by SciPy Conference co-chair Andy Terrel and attendee Kristen Thyng. The mixer was co-sponsored by generous support from NumFOCUS, the Python Software Foundation, and the SciPy conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately three women attended SciPy 2012. In 2013, there was a substantially higher representation of women, with about 35 women or 10% of the participants between the tutorials, the conference, and the sprints. However, this number is still low, and more elucidating is how the numbers break down by participation activity. More detailed numbers for female participation are as follows, noting that some of these numbers are exact and some are rough best estimates since demographic information was not gathered from conference participants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/18 active program committee members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 of about 10 lightning talks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/5 awardees for the plotting competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 of about 20 tutorial leaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2/13 sponsored students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3/19 conference co-chairs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authors or co-authors on at least 13 of 120 submissions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 3 of 27 poster presenters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 4 of 70 speakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andy.terrel.us/figures/3-IMG_0728.JPG" title="Image title&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;45%" /&gt; &lt;img alt="" src="http://andy.terrel.us/figures/4-IMG_0732.JPG" title="Image title&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;45%" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after arriving at the event, people became acquainted with each other and started chatting. There was a good number of people at the mixer to meet new people but still have a chance to meet everyone. There were, all together, 16 people at the mixer: 13 women and 3 men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the group formed a circle in order to have a chance to have a discussion. The discussion covered many topics. Specific special interest groups for women in computing were brought up and women attending the mixer had positive things to say about the groups. In fact, many of them were attending the conference due to encouragement from PyLadies. They found that PyLadies was a less intimidating way to meet and talk and learn about Python than a regular Meetup group. In particular, some women found the Learn Python group to be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For helping to get women (and men) who are already interested in computing to learn more and therefore be able to participate more in a conference like SciPy, it was suggested to have a separate tutorials and talk track for introductory material, and have proper tools for self-assessment to make sure participants can correctly choose their path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked whether a separate women's track at the conference would be desirable, participants said that they would not like this because they would rather be able to attend whatever track best fit their interests, and would not like to be singled out when it came to the research material itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentorship at the next SciPy between women (and possibly men) who have previously attended a SciPy (or related) conference was suggested to help new participants feel more comfortable in what might be a new community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was brought up that few iPython (and other package) contributors are women. Possible reasons suggested to explain this included that women may not feel comfortable contributing when men are aggressive and blunt. This is something that could be addressed by increased understanding and awareness on all sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference Code of Conduct was brought up as was how prominent to make the statement and how best to preempt any potential problems. Participants agreed that having previously established rules for how to deal with problems was worth any time that was spent on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was unanimous that people at the SciPy conference had been accepting and friendly to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question brought up was how to get more women involved with conference planning, which could then in turn help the conference be more inclusive and diverse in the future, keeping in mind that sometimes women are cautious not to be stuck "just" planning and organizing, which could be considered a traditionally female task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get more women to attend SciPy and submit abstracts, people thought that helping with the process could be beneficial. This sort of support would be most logical to come from a group like PyLadies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://andy.terrel.us/figures/5-IMG_0736.JPG" title="Image title&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;45%" /&gt; &lt;img alt="" src="http://andy.terrel.us/figures/6-IMG_0737.JPG" title="Image title&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;45%" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various organizations were suggested as being helpful to seek out, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://numfocus.org"&gt;NumFOCUS&lt;/a&gt; (has funds for scholarships and women intiatives along with resources)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://adainitiative.org"&gt;Ada Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pyladies.com"&gt;PyLadies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen"&gt;Outreach Program for Women (OPW)&lt;/a&gt; (Internships for women in computing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeWomen"&gt;GNOME Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engr.utexas.edu/wep/"&gt;Women in Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (UT program to encourage and provide support for female students in the engineering program. Similar programs are sometimes available at other universities.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://software-carpentry.org"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; (teaching/learning materials are available online)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.girlswhocode.com"&gt;Girls Who Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general suggestion for getting more people to SciPy was to have differentiated funding for people coming from companies versus those who are paying their own way (and are not academics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a good time was had by all and it was very enjoyable meeting and discussing with a small group of like-minded individuals. Having these sorts of discussions could be helpful in having a more diverse set of scientific coders over time!

Terrel</name></author><id>tag:andy.terrel.us,2013-07-07:blog/2013/07/07/numpy-scipy-benchmarks/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At PyCon2013, a group of about 30 developers got together to discuss
NumPy and SciPy.  The room mostly included folks that use NumPy and
SciPy extensively, such as myself, a few who were just learning, and
several core contributors (if not currently in the past), such as Eric
Jones, Travis Oliphant, Anthony Scopatz, and Jake Vanderplas.  It was
an impromptu meeting, as most birds of a feather sessions are, so I
don't think we even got the full number of interested participants at
PyCon2013.  The scientific large support at PyCon was surprising,
since most of us scientists think the wider Python ecosystem leaves us
behind in many of their activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three topics we discussed: briefly about the development and
maintenance of the libraries, about the use of newer technologies, e.g. Cython,
PyPy, Copperhead, Numba, and finally about having a benchmark for new
implementations of NumPy to see how complete they are.  Since there were not
very many core developers in the room, it was hard to really push a topic on
the development side but the other two topics were the most discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To briefly summarize the maintenance and future plans section, I asked about
how the community was doing since I've been organizing this whole conference
thing and haven't been on the mailing lists in a while. Travis mentioned that
NumFOCUS was trying to raise money for the projects, especially around the
topic of paying a maintainer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Miniature Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we turn to the topic of benchmarks.  At the end we decided that there are
at least two types of benchmarks that are really needed by the community.
First, is a set of miniature applications that show off the tools well.  Since
there is such a wide variety of tools available right now, it is difficult to
know what to invest in as a developer.  Ian Osvald mentioned his book that
includes one of the only major comparisons I've seen in the tools.  I suggested
we look at how the Mantevo project implemented its mini-apps for the US DOE.
Another suggestion was to organize the applications in the seven dwarfs
of scientific computing suggested by Phil Collela. I believe these have been
renamed to motifs and extended to eleven by the Berkeley crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea moving forward will be to collect a number of applications, give a
reference implementation, and accept contributions showing how to implement
them in a Python runnable way.  The idea is not to make everyone use Python for
everything but to show off the capabilities of Python as an integration (and
implementation) platform.  One participant brought up that we could have a site
like the Computer Language Benchmarks, while we agreed in spirit enough of us
do not like that benchmark because of its purist ideas that applications should
stick to a single language.  To be friendly to vendor solutions, I'm willing to
accept closed runtimes but since the point is to highlight the code, all code
must be free and open, preferably BSD.  I am sure we will refine the rules as
we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NumPy Benchmarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matti, a contributor to NumPyPy, brought up the idea of creating a suite of
benchmarks to compare different implementations of NumPy.  The idea here is
once again not to compete ruthlessly for fame and glory, but rather provide a
baseline for developer to hit when implementing alternatives and users to know
how complete and single implementation is. Right now I know of several NumPy
implementations (or close to implementations), e.g., NumPyPy, Numba,
Copperhead, and a benchmark will be a welcome addition to the tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to start off will be to grab out some tests from the NumPy regression
tests and grab a benchmark runner.  Matti suggested trying to port the PyPy
runners for our needs. Once we get something up and going we can try to put it
up somewhere for people to make contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many concerns about the benchmarks not being productive and bringing
out too much competition.  My view is that we should try to be as open and
welcoming as the rest of the Python ecosystem.  That is let the numbers speak
for themselves and make these benchmarks something anyone can contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final aspect of the benchmark would be to show off that NumPy is useful for
more then numeric algorithms.  Many people see "Num" and assume there is no use
for their specific needs, but in actuality, NumPy should be thought of as more
a typed array.  This allows fast access to contiguous blocks (although the
element access is often slower than lists).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is intended to start a wider discussion among the community.  I'm
posting here because there are enough places in the community and I wanted a
single place rather than four or five mailing lists.  The hope is we can start
a repository and get some tests rolling.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Python"></category><category term="NumPy"></category><category term="SciPy"></category></entry><entry><title>Usefulness of a University</title><link href="http://andy.terrel.us/blog/2013/04/08/use-of-a-university/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-08T21:08:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Andy R.

installation, got me all in a tissy.  I even signed up for their mailing list!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first impression with SWC was a wonderful community that in encouraging
folks to learn computing skills.  After witnessing the TeachScheme movement, I
was skeptical that two day bootcamps could really have any impact, but then
again I'm usually wrong.  Now coming off two and a half years of supporting
users on supercomputers, I too see the frustration that started SWC in the
first place.  Scientists waste quite a lot of time not using the tools
effectively, but then again I waste too much time futzing with tools.  The
current frustration is over the view of what education of these tools actually
is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a university education?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my best friends in life were made in the classrooms of my
university education.  While learning the essence of science, math and
philosophy, something else was happening as well.  I was participating in a
community of learning.  These friends were the ones who helped me struggle
through problems, understand new topics, and motivate my continued education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While one can go through Bloom's Taxonomy and be as theoretical as one likes, I
have yet to see many people actually discuss the building of a community around
your classroom.  For most open source developers, this is the major draw, to
work on hard problems with a set of intellectually challenging peers.  I will
say that some tools are being developed to help this, such as Piazza. At the
end of the day, MOOCs, bootcamps, and plain-ol-lectures that don't give
students the ability to actively engage an topic on their own terms isn't worth
its salt.  Developing communities around learning is another method for
continuing the education process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the only thing that a University is providing that other methods of
teaching hasn't touched is this community of learning.  To me that's the
biggest problem in alternative university education, there is no community of
learning after the day ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(On that note I have an unfunded grant proposal to turn textbooks into
community initiators. Perhaps I'll get my act together and pursue it again.)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
