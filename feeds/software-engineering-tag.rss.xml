That is the point without usefulness there is no
need for existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you write a function that is not useful, scrub it from your text editors
as not to offend the blessed pixels. Do not fear throwing away non-useful parts
of your code, better to cast away these parts rather than sacrifice the
usefulness of the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is useful to repeat yourself, do so.  Repeating yourself in subtly
different ways teaches your novices, which must be done well. If there is a
common pattern for your task use it, until it is not useful anymore. Write your
tests as soon as they will be useful, tests are always useful before giving
your code to others. Separate your code into useful partitions. If the
partitions are too big or too small the usefulness will be clouded as it is
difficult to track the function and interplay between the partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the program is done, let it stand on its usefulness.  If others do not
find it useful, seek out more to judge your craft. If none count themselves
blessed to have witnessed your skill, throw out the program. Better had the
program not been born than to prop it up with false claims of usefulness or
many words about its beauty, adherence to principles, or features that none
have found useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each programmer must look from within to find the metric of usefulness.
Some programs are only useful to the programmer, others must be useful to a
multiplicity of programmers, and few hold themselves to such high esteem as
being useful to the unwashed non-programming masses.  Do not make the program
raise malcontent by seeking affection in those it cannot help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API can hold back the usefulness of your code. Write many useful programs
with the API and minimize their length.  Large APIs are weaker than small APIs,
but both can be useful.  Do not be afraid to erase parts of the API which were
only scaffolding to find the better API, the masterpiece could not have been
made without the scaffolding, but if it is left standing it will obstruct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the performance guru tells you speed is more important, ask them why they
don't make their users write in assembly, why BLAS doesn't require you to pack
your own matrices, and why the CMS doesn't make you connect to your own
sockets. To discourage performance hacks give the programmer five lashes as
these hacks are the enemy of abstraction, which can be useful. If the
programmer persist in their hacks, let them continue as clearly the speed is
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the enterprise architect recommends yet another abstract factory
manager class, ask them why they started programming and at what point they
decided to make others despise reading their code.  Separate them from the
strong, eager, useful programmers and burn their resumes so that others do not
confuse their ways as useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the functional zealot tells you your side effects destroy the formal
analysis, explain to him that monads rhymes with gonads which are quite
useful. Ask them to travel discalced to the far reaches of the empty quarter so
they do not harm useful programmers ears.  Remember these prophets ramblings as
even they are sometimes useful. Teach them to the young, but always remind them
of the first rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your sales representative tells you to remove the useful parts of your
code, give them wind and ask them to sell the liberated air.  When your project
manager wants features that are not useful, give them a shovel and ask them to
remove dirt from the parched earth only to have them place it back again for
they have forgotten the first rule and should be left to sisyphean
tasks. When other programmers check in code that is not useful, give them the
rule and ask them if they are on the path to manager or guru.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Andy R.
