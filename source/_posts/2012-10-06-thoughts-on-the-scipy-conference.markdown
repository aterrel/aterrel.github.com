For SciPy2012 I was given the privilege of serving as the co-chair of the
program committee.  The experience was exciting and rewarding as I was able to
affect what I view as one of the most important conferences for the scientific
world. Now, that's a pretty bold statement and I'm not going to dwell on it
long here, but essentially many conferences are where people go to show off;
SciPy is a conference were people come to learn best practices.  And when young
scientists are able to see science rock stars like Joshua Bloom lift up the
covers and show off how his scientific process works, it changes their entire
workflow creating more efficient, better scientists. With that said, I would
like to focus more on my opinions about the state of the conference, its
successes and failures, and how I believe the conference should be transformed.

## The state of the SciPy Community

It was a bit strange being the co-chair of the program committee at SciPy2012,
because prior to 2012 I had only attended one SciPy conference.  Of course, I
have known about the conference for years and have tried to go many times but
life has always gotten in the way.  Additionally, I came to the scientific
Python community after most everything had evolved to a pretty high level of
quality.  Sure there are bits and pieces that could use some polish, but
largely I feel that my contributions have all been cosmetic (although the GSOC
students I have mentored have done phenomenal work). This puts me at a bit of a
disadvantage to extol any long history of the SciPy community, but I'm sure you
guys will let me know where I get things right and wrong.

There are some interesting divides in the community.  For example, SciPy can
refer to many different things:

1. The US SciPy conference,
2. The international SciPy conference series,
3. The Python package named scipy,
4. The basic scientific computing stack used by most pythonista, and/or
5. Any piece of code slightly related to science and Python

For this article, when I say SciPy I am talking about the US SciPy conference
(since if I usually can't afford to make it to SciPy in Austin, TX, I sure
can't afford to go to Brussels or India) and a mix of the other topics.  SciPy
was originally a set of friends who got together in a room at Caltech to chat
and hack about the scipy package.  They use to have these talks from the core
devs where each gave a summary of the package and largely discuss technical
issues around these packages.  As of late, the conference has turned into much
more of a place where any scientist or technical computing professional can go
and hear about a very wide variety of topics on science and Python.

This change in community is both a good and a bad thing.  It means that at
coffee, there are a lot of strange faces and let's be honest if we were the
most social crowd we wouldn't have spent a non-trivial amount of our lives
pouring over code and mathematics.  Second we seem to have lost some of the
core devs attention.  For example, in the months preceding the conference the
numpy mailing list had turned into a pretty nasty flamewar.  At the conference,
I only saw one of the major contributors to the numpy code base.  I find the
fact that SciPy isn't the most important event on the calendar for these devs
kind of surprising.  After all this is where you core devs are the gurus
everyone has come to be inspired by.

TODO: Finish off good things
The good news is that we are able to see a more accurate view of the
penetration of Python in science.  But not only science, pretty much all
technical computing areas of industry, academia, and government were
represented.  

## Successes and Failures of SciPy 2012

### Success
* Great topics
* Fabulous plenaries
* Poster session
* Domain science symposiums

### Failures
* Diversity
* Social Media
* Industy/Academia interactions
* Community involvement in planning

## Vision

* Create a community around the conference similar to PyCon
* Get the developers back
* Engage with more industrial partners
